üìâ Telco Customer Churn Prediction

A complete end-to-end data science project to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn. This project covers data analysis, machine learning modeling, and deployment using Streamlit.

-- Dataset Overview

Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset

Size: 7043 records, 21 features

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Features include:

Demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

Services: InternetService, PhoneService, TechSupport, StreamingTV, etc.

Contract & Payment: Contract type, Payment method, PaperlessBilling

Usage & Charges: Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges

-- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Insights

‚úÖ Key Observations:

Churn Rate: ~26.58%

High Churn Groups:

Senior Citizens (with ~90% churn for label 1)

Customers without Tech Support

Customers on Month-to-Month contracts

Fiber optic internet users

Low Churn Groups:

Customers with Two-Year Contracts

Customers with Tech Support

Those with no internet service (also low engagement)

-- Visual Highlights:

Contract Type vs Churn:

Month-to-Month: Highest churn (~43%)

Two Year: Lowest (~3.6%)

Tech Support Impact:

No Tech Support: Churn Rate ~45%

With Tech Support: Churn ~15%

Streaming Services:

No Streaming TV: Slightly higher churn

Tenure & Monthly Charges:

Low tenure users are more likely to churn

High charges increase churn likelihood

-- Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding

Converted TotalCharges to numeric (handled empty string conversion)

Mapped target variable Churn to binary: Yes = 1, No = 0

Removed irrelevant feature: customerID

--Model Building & Evaluation

Trained multiple models and compared their performance.

Final Chosen Model: Logistic Regression

--Streamlit Deployment

Built an interactive Streamlit web app where users can input customer details and get real-time churn predictions.

Live Demo:

Inputs:

Gender, Senior Status, Partner, Dependents

Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges

Contract Type, Internet Service, Tech Support, etc.

Output:

Prediction: Churn / No Churn
